# Image Verification BadgeWizard

This project demonstrates how to verify badge images using Python. It includes a verification function and an example script.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: You need Python 3.x installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Winssench/BadgeWizard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd BadgeWizard
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Tests

To run unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated (if used).
